# Projects

Some of the projects listed here are just pure fun or trying to keep in touch with technology, I do not work with on a daily business. Others are to always find good katas for testing coding skills of others and just to name a few here:

* Resources for a [proper machine setup](https://github.com/rockaBe/dotfiles) as well as for [reading and learning the right stuff](https://github.com/rockaBe/professional-programming)
* Solutions to to the problems specified in the Euler Project (https://projecteuler.net) added to [project-euler](https://github.com/rockaBe/project-euler) are not only to find interesting questions (e.g. for interviews) but also to solve performance and magnitude issues in javascript
